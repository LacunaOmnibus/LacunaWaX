<h1>Station Propositions Screen</h1>

This screen shows all propositions currently pending on this Station.  You can enter Yes 
or No votes for yourself for each proposition.
<p>

More usefully, you can also enter Yes votes for each alliance member for whom you have a 
sitter password recorded in the <a href="menu_tools_sitter_manager.html">Sitter 
Manager</a>.
<p>

It's common for several alliance officers to maintain a list of members' sitter passwords 
for exactly this purpose - pushing votes through as they come in.
<p>

Each alliance has different rules.  It's ultimately your decision who you send your sitter 
to, but most alliances do want you to at least give your sitter to the alliance leader.  
But be careful about who you give it to - use your best judgement.
