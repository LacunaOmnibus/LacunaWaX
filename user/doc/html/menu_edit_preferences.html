<h1>Edit... Preferences</h1>

Before connecting to a server, only the Server tab will available under Preferences.  
After connecting, a second tab, "Autovote", will appear.
<p>

<h2>Server Tab</h2>
Allows you to set up your connection preferences for each of the game servers.
<ul>
    <li>
        Username - your empire's name
    </li>
    <li>
        Password - your empire's password, either sitter or full (sitter is recommended, 
        though full is required to fire the BFG).
    </li>
    <li>
        Protocol - either 'http' or 'https'.  Https is recommended unless you're having a 
        specific problem with it.  If you're sure that your empire name and password have 
        both been entered correctly, but LacunaWaX still can't connect, change the 
        protocol to 'http'.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>General Tab</h2>

Allows you to set your clock type (12- or 24- hour, as you prefer), and your time zone.  
Your time zone is most likely already correct; if the <em>Here</em> clock in the status 
bar is showing you the correct current time in your location, then the time zone has been 
set correctly.
<p>

However, you can change the time zone used to determine that Local time if you wish.  A 
full list of time zones can be found on <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">Wikipedia</a>.
<p>

It's often mentioned that the game's server time is noted in GMT.  The linked Wikipedia 
page has a column labeled "UTC" - for all intents and purposes, UTC and GMT are exactly 
the same thing.
