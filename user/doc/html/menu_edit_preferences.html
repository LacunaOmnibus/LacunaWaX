<h1>Edit... Preferences</h1>

Before connecting to a server, only the Server tab will available under Preferences.  
After connecting, a second tab, "Autovote", will appear.
<p>

<h2>Server Tab</h2>
Allows you to set up your connection preferences for each of the game servers.
<ul>
    <li>
        Username - your empire's name
    </li>
    <li>
        Password - your empire's password, either sitter or full (sitter is recommended, 
        though full is required to fire the BFG).
    </li>
    <li>
        Protocol - either 'http' or 'https'.  Https is recommended unless you're having a 
        specific problem with it.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Autovote Tab</h2>

This does absolutely nothing useful unless you set up the <a 
href="schedule_setup.html">Schedule_autovote.exe program</a>.  Once you do that, your 
preferences on this tab determine which propositions you will automatically vote for.
<p>

You can chose 'None' (no voting at all), 'Owner' (vote only for propositions that were 
submitted by the current owner of the station), or 'All' (vote for all propositions 
submitted at this station).
<p>

Those preferences apply to <em>all</em> stations in your alliance.  There is currently no 
way to eg set one station to vote for Owner and another to vote for All.
<p>

'All' is generally recommended.
<p>

<h2>General Tab</h2>

Allows you to set your clock type (12- or 24- hour, as you prefer), and your time zone.  
Your time zone is most likely already correct; if the <em>Local</em> clock in the status 
bar is showing you the correct current time in your location, then it's correct.
<p>

However, you can change the time zone used to determine that Local time if you wish.  A 
full list of time zones can be found on <a 
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones">Wikipedia</a>.
<p>

It's often mentioned that the game's server time is noted in GMT.  The linked Wikipedia 
page has a column labeled "UTC" - for all intents and purposes, UTC and GMT are exactly 
the same thing.
