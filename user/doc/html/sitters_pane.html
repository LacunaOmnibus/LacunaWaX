<h1>Sitter Manager</h1>

This allows you to record any sitter passwords friends and alliance members may have given 
you.
<p>

When you enter a new empire name and sitter password, the Add button will automatically 
test the given credentials to make sure they're valid, and then save them if they are.
<p>

If a friend has changed their sitter and sends you their new one, you can simply type the 
new sitter in place of the old one and click Update, which will also test the new sitter 
before saving it.
<p>

If you've had a sitter in your list for a while and are unsure if it's still valid, you 
can click the Test button, which will simply test the displayed credentials and let you 
know if they're good or not.
<p>

Recorded passwords start out displayed as passwords (rows of dots), rather than the actual 
password, to avoid over-the-shoulder viewing.  To view any sitter password, simply click 
the eyeball button.
<p>

An empire name and its sitter can be completely deleted by clicking the X button.
<p>

The credentials listed here are used by the vote pusher on the <a 
href="voting_pane.html">Voting Screen</a>.
<p>

<strong>Caution</strong> - ALL passwords recorded by LacunaWaX need to be passed to the 
game server in plaintext, and they are therefore stored in LacunaWaX's internal database 
in plaintext.  This database is stored on your machine in
<blockquote><code>
    [%user_dir%][%dir_sep%]lacuna_app.sqlite
</blockquote></code>
If you ever send that file to anyone, you're effectively handing them your own login 
credentials along with every sitter you have stored.
<p>

So don't do that.
