<h1>Space Station thinks it's a Planet</h1>

<h2>The Short Version</h2>

Double-click on the name of the station in the tree on the left.  This will bring up a 
summary page about that station.  Now that you've done that, LacunaWaX will figure out 
that this is a Station, not a Planet.
<p>

Close and restart LacunaWaX, and your station will now be recognized as a station forever; 
you won't need to do this again.
<p>

<h2>The Longer Explanation</h2>

When you log in to the game, your connection information includes a list of "bodies" that 
belong to you.  In TLE, a "body" is any thing that can orbit a star, the main ones being 
Planets, Space Stations, and Asteroids.
<p>

The problem with this list of known bodies is that it does not indicate whether a given 
body is a Planet or a Space Station.  To figure that out, LacunaWaX needs to send a 
question to the server ("Hey, what kind of Thing is this particular body?").  Sending that 
question to the server for all of your owned bodies can take a long time.
<p>

So instead of asking the server about each body every time, LacunaWaX waits until you have 
clicked on a given body's name to bring up the summary screen for that body.  Once you've 
done that one time, LacunaWaX now knows what kind of Thing that Body is (Planet or Space 
Station).  Once LacunaWaX has that information one time, it remembers it forever.
<p>

So the first time you start LacunaWaX after one of your alliance mates, or even you, 
launches a new SS, LacunaWaX won't know yet that this new body is an SS, and will treat it 
as a planet.  Double-click on that new body's name, then close and re-start LacunaWaX, and 
the body will now be seen as a Space Station.
