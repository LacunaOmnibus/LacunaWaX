<h1>File... Export Database</h1>

Exports your current LacunaWaX preferences database to a file.
<p>

It's a good idea to do this every once in a while, especially if you have a long list of 
sitters that you don't keep anywhere else, just so you have a backup.
<p>

Also, if you're preparing to upgrade to a new version of LacunaWaX, you'll want to export 
your current preferences first.  The upgraded version will start out with all preferences 
wiped clean, but it will have the option to import previously-saved preferences.
