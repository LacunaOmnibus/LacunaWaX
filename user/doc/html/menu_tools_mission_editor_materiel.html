<h1>Mission Editor Materiel Objectives</h1>

These are the resources, ships, glyphs, etc that the user must provide to complete the 
mission.
<p>

You can add as many objectives as you like; just make sure they make sense in the context 
of your mission's description.
<p>

The red "X" button to the right of each objective will completely remove that objective if 
you realize that you added something that you shouldn't have.
