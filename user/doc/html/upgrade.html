<h1>Upgrading to a new version of LacunaWaX</h1>

<h2>Windows</h2>

To upgrade, you'll first have to uninstall your current version of LacunaWaX using the 
standard Add/Remove Programs dialog.
<p>

When you install the new version, it will wipe all of your preferences!  To keep from 
having to re-enter everything again, do the following:

<ul>
    <li>
        In your current version of LacunaWaX, use the File... Export Database tool to 
        export your current database to a file.
    </li>
    <li>
        Uninstall LacunaWaX.
    </li>
    <li>
        Install the shiny new version of LacunaWaX and start it.
    </li>
    <li>
        As soon as the new version starts (before even logging in), use the File... Import 
        Preferences tool.  Point it at the file you'd exported in the first step to import 
        all of your previous preferences.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Non-Windows</h2>

Your version of LacunaWaX doesn't have an installer, but the process of upgrading is 
otherwise the same as the Windows process.
<p>

Export your current version's database using File... Export Database, and put that file 
someplace where you can retrieve it.  Then unzip your new version and use that version's 
File... Import Preferences to import the file you'd previously exported.
