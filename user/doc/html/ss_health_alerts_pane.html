<h1>Monitor Health Alerts</h1>

This panel allows you to choose to be alerted when possibly negative things happen to a 
station.
<p>

There are several alert types you can enable for a station:
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Turn on alerts</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                This must be on for any alerts to work.  Enabling any alert will 
                automatically turn this on, and turning this off will automatically 
                disable all alerts.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enable hostile ship alerts</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Alerts you if any hostile ships are inbound.
            </li>
            <li>
                "Hostile" means "not from your alliance".
            </li>
            <li>
                Requires a Police Station.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enable hostile spy alerts</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Alerts you if any hostile spies are onsite.
            </li>
            <li>
                There's no way to tell if a foreign spy (in this case, "foreign" means 
                "not owned by you") is actually hostile or not.  So what this is actually 
                doing is checking what task foreign spies are assigned to.  If it's 
                anything other than "Counter Espionage", the spies are considered to be 
                hostile.
            </li>
            <li>
                Requires a Police Station.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Enable own star seizure alerts?</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Alerts if the star that the station is orbiting is not seized by the 
                station itself.
            </li>
            <li>
                A station's star should certainly be seized by a station belonging to your 
                alliance.  This is generally the current station, but in some cases, one 
                of your alliance's stations will have seized the stars of another of your 
                alliance's stations.  If that's the case, don't enable this alert, or 
                you'll get false positives.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Alert if any res drops below X (per hour)</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Alerts if any of your stations resource per hour counts drops below this 
                number.  This is a big one; if the station's supplier goes awol, or gets 
                hit by a fissure, or is under attack, or any number of things, then the 
                station's res production will drop.  This is easy to miss.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Mail</h2>
Alerts will be sent to you in game mail.  If you're in the habit of ignoring your mail or 
deleting it all by repeating Select All... Delete without looking at all of your messages, 
<em>you must fix that habit!</em>  You should always choose "Correspondence" from the 
dropdown box in the in-game mailbox before deleting a bunch of mail.  This will hide all 
the junk mail you've received, and only show mails from players.
<p>

Since the health alert mails are sent from your own account to yourself, they count as 
"mails sent from players".
