<h1>Mission Editor Fleet Objectives</h1>

This allows you to require that the user send a ship or ships to specific locations in the 
expanse.
<p>

Most missions won't have any fleet requirements at all, and most of those that do will 
only require sending a single ship.  However, you can create your mission to require 
sending as many ships as you like.
