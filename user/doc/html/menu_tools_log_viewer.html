<h1>Tools... Log Viewer</h1>

The Log Viewer tool provides information about what the various scheduled programs have 
been up to.  They produce no visible output, and you'll sometimes want to check on them to 
make sure they're all doing The Right Thing.
<p>

Choose the type of log entry you're interested in by clicking the appropriate radio button 
up top.  You'll see log entries from both the "Schedule" component and the component you 
just selected.
<p>

Each time either LacunaWaX itself or any of its scheduled components is run, that run is 
assigned a unique "Run" number.  Log entries in the Log Viewer are grouped together by 
this Run number, showing the most recent runs first.  Within each run, log entries are 
displayed from oldest to newest (so, from the beginning of the run till the end of it).
<p>

Log entries older than seven days get auto-pruned by LacunaWaX, so you don't have to worry 
about the log growing forever.
