<h1>Embassy Propositions Screen</h1>

This is very much like the propositions screen that shows up under each space station.  
But the propositions that display here will be <i>all</i> propositions currently up for 
vote across all of the space stations in your alliance.
<p>

If you're in a hurry to push through all of the propositions on a specific station, you're 
still better off using that station's own props screen.  But if you just want to push all 
of your alliance's props with one click, this is the place.

Propositions Screen</a>.
