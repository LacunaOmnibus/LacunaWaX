<h1>Tools... GLC</h1>

This will install the current version of the most popular and common scripting library, 
Games::Lacuna::Client (which I'll refer to as just "GLC" from now on), as well as the Perl 
libraries it depends on.
<p>

This will <em>not</em> install Perl itself for you; you'll need to do that yourself first.  
I tend to recommend <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads">ActiveState 
Perl</a> (use version 5.16, <strong>not 5.18</strong>), but <a 
href="http://strawberryperl.com/">Strawberry Perl</a> should work as well if you prefer 
that.
<p>

Once you have Perl installed, you can use these tools to get yourself a working scripting 
setup without (hopefully) all the heartache.
<p>

<strong>Non-Windows Users</strong> - these tools should work just fine on not-windows.  
The directions below are Windows-centric because, well, you know why.  But they should 
work for any OS.
<p>

<h2>Install GLC</h2>
This will download and extract the current version of GLC for you, and set up your config 
file as well.
<p>

The config file includes your empire name and password.  The only way for LacunaWaX to 
know which credentials to use are for you to connect first, so this Install GLC option 
will be disabled until you connect to a server.
<p>

Once connected to the server, selecting Tools... Install GLC will display a directory 
chooser window.  You can choose to download GLC to any directory you wish, but I recommend 
using <code>C:\Lacuna\tsee</code>.  This is the standard directory structure for 
installing GLC, and installing there will make it easier for you to get help if you need 
it.  If that directory does not already exist, the directory chooser window will allow you 
to create it.
<p>

After selecting the directory, the most recent version of GLC will be downloaded, 
unzipped, extracted, and your config file will be created.
<p>

<h2>Install Mods</h2>
The scripts included in the GLC package require a number of other Perl modules be 
installed.  Selecting Tools... Install Mods will attempt to install them for you.
<p>

Re-installing modules you've already got installed won't hurt anything.  You don't have to 
tell this tool where you installed Perl, or give it any other information.  Just select it 
and it will do its best to install the required modules for you.
<p>

<h2>Testing the Setup</h2>
After installing GLC and the required modules, you should be able to open a CMD window and 
move to the GLC examples directory, where the scripts are stored:
<ul>
    <li>
        Start... Run... type "CMD.exe"
    </li>
    <li>
        In the black window that pops up, type:<br>
        <code>cd C:\Lacuna\tsee\examples</code><br>
        (if you installed GLC somewhere else, you're on your own to figure out how to get 
        there).
    </li>
    <li>
        Test by running the build_report script.  Make sure that you've got at least one 
        building in the build queue at any one of your colonies, then type:<br>
        <code>perl build_report.pl</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        The script will take several seconds to connect and talk to the server, and then 
        it will begin producing reports on what's building on which planets.
    </li>
    <li>
        The script may stop, producing an error that looks like:<br>
        <code>RPC Error (1010): Slow down YOURNAME! No more than 60 requests per minute.  
        </code><br>
        That's fine.  The point of this exercise was to test that your setup works.  If 
        you see that error, you're in good shape..
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Step</h2>
From here, you just need to learn about the individual scripts.  How they work, how they 
need to be called, etc.
