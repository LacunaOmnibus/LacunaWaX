<h1>Tools... Mission Editor</h1>

Create your own missions and upload them for use in TLE.
<p>

As you work on a mission, you can Save it as often as you want, and then come back and 
work on it later.
<p>

When you're happy with your mission, Export it to a file, which you can then upload to the 
<a href="http://community.lacunaexpanse.com/forums/missions">Missions forum</a>.
<p>

Any mission can be Deleted at any time, but note that this will completely wipe it.
