<h1>Adding Help Documents</h1>

Adding new help documents is easy.  Even if you don't know any HTML, the markup used in 
the help files is very simple, and you should be able to figure it out just by looking at 
what's already there.
<p>

All of the pages of this help system are stored on your machine in
<blockquote><code><font size="-1">
    [% html_dir %]
</font></code></blockquote>

Browse to that directory and edit any of the .html files you find there.  You can edit 
existing help files and see your edits immediately in the Help browser window - browse to 
the page you're editing, make your changes, then click 'back' and then 'forward' again to 
get back to the page on which you're working.  Upon coming back to that page, you should 
be able to see your edits.
<p>

If you want to make a new Help file, your best bet is to copy one of the existing ones 
(<code>ss_as_planet.html</code> is probably a good candidate), give your copy a good 
descriptive name (make sure it ends in ".html"), and edit away.
<p>

When you're finished editing, link your new help document in <code>index.html</code> where 
ever it makes sense to do so; follow the existing examples.
<p>

<h2>Make your changes show up in the search index</h2>

In that same directory with the help files is a subdirectory (folder) called
<blockquote><code><font size="-1">
    [% lucy_index %]
</font></code></blockquote>

...that subdirectory is the search index.  <em>Delete it completely</em>.  Then close and 
restart LacunaWaX.  The next time you open the Help browser, that search index will be 
automatically re-created, and will include any edits or new files you just added, so 
searches will turn up your new documents.

<h2>"I do know some HTML, and these help files look awfully sparse!"</h2>

The help documents themselves are actually templates, and all the standard HTML 
boilerplate header and footer stuff is being dealt with elsewhere.
<p>

So most of the Help files consist of a few headers (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, etc), some 
paragraph breaks (&lt;p&gt;), the help content itself, and not much else.
<p>

You may notice that the help files are not using any CSS, and are using (ack!) font tags 
in a few places.  This is not because I'm a horrible human being.  It's because the HTML 
parser being used in this window is fairly basic, and simply does not understand CSS.

<h2>"I've made some updates or edits to help documents.  What now?"</h2>

All you need to do now is submit a pull request to the <a 
href="https://github.com/tmtowtdi/LacunaWaX">main LacunaWaX github repository</a>.  If 
you're not sure how to do that, you might be able to find a friend or alliance member who 
does know, and just send the help files to them and have them submit the pull request on 
your behalf.  Most alliances have at least one member who can manage that, since it's the 
same way that the alliance logos had to be submitted.
