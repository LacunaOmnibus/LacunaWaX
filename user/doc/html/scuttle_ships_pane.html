<h1>Scuttle Ships</h1>

This is pretty simple; it scuttles (destroys) ships you no longer need or want.
<p>

Chose the type of ship from the dropdown, and indicate how many to scuttle, and click the 
button.
<p>

If the number you chose is larger than the number you actually have, (eg you have 100 
cargo ships but run the spinner up to 107), your 100 cargo ships will be scuttled.
