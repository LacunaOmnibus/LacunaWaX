<h1>Rearrange Screen</h1>

<h2>Thanks Jazz</h2>
I had used Jazz's building mover program quite a bit, and found that I missed being able 
to use it when I switched over to my Ubuntu machine.  So this rearranger screen was the 
first bit of LacunaWaX I created, and draws its layout from Jazz's program.

<h2>Rearranging Buildings</h2>
Simply click the building you want to move (it will get "picked up"), then click where you 
want to lay it back down again.
<p>

If the destination square already contained a building, it will be replaced with the one 
you most recently "picked up", and it will now be the one "picked up".  When all your 
buildings are laid out the way you want them, click the Rearrange button at the bottom.
<p>

If you decide that the layout you've been working on is awful and want to start over 
again, click the Reload button to reset everything.

After rearranging your buildings, if you already had that planet open in your browser, 
you'll need to refresh the planet surface in your browser to see the changes.
