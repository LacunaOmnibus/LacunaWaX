<h1>Build Ships</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This panel allows you to build large numbers of the same type of ship.  The panel will 
start building as many ships as it can in all appropriate shipyards.  If you wanted to 
build more ships than can be made in a single pass, the panel will then wait until the 
first batch of ships finishes, then it will pick up and build another batch.
<p>

Once you start a build, you may leave the Ship Builder panel and continue using LacunaWaX 
for whatever else you need it to do.  Just don't close it until all of your ships have 
completed, or the next batch of ships won't begin building.
<p>

<h2>How-To</h2>

This panel starts out with all controls disabled except for a numbered spinner.  Use that 
spinner to chose the lowest level shipyard you want to use to build ships.  The point of 
this is that a higher-level shipyard will build better ships than a lower-level shipyard.  
If you're currently leveling up a shipyard, you may not want to use it to build 
substandard ships.
<p>

After chosing your minimum shipyard level, a summary of your available docks and current 
ships will appear, and the rest of the on-screen controls will now be enabled.
<p>

Choose the type of ship you want to build in the dropdown.  For convenience, you can use 
the checkboxes to limit which types of ships are listed there (eg if you want to build 
sweepers, check only the War checkbox).
<p>

Choose the number of ships to build.  Again, this can be a much larger number than is 
supported by your shipyards - 1000 is reasonable.  Then click the Build! button, and your 
build will begin.
