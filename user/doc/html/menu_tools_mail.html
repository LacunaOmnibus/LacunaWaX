<h2>Clear Mail</h2>
This allows you to clear messages from your Inbox, which is handy when SS owners get 
upgrade-happy, or when fireartist's mapping script gets to your little corner of the 
expanse and you're inundated with probe messages.
<p>

Simply check the boxes of the types of mails you want to delete, then click the Clear 
Selected Messages button.  If desired, you can choose to only delete mail you've already 
read.
<p>

<h2>Send Intra-Alliance Mail</h2>
This allows you to send mail to members of your alliance, either to the entire alliance or 
to select members.  Choose as many recipients as you wish from the drop-down box, then 
enter your desired Subject and Body and click Send.
<p>

If you accidentally chose a recipient you didn't mean to, just click the Clear button next 
to the To: field and start over.
<p>

Note that mail sent from this form is bypassing the sometimes overzealous in-game 
profanity filter, which is why the form can only be used to send mail to your alliance 
members.
<p>

Even though it's restricted to alliance members, keep in mind that your alliance may have 
members who don't appreciate a mailbox full of profanity.  So say what you need to say, 
but use some judgement, and be aware of who's on your recipients list.
