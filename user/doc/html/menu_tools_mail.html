<h1>Tools... Mail</h1>

This option will be disabled until you have connected to a game server.

<h2>Clear Mail</h2>
This allows you to clear messages from your Inbox, which is handy when SS owners get 
upgrade-happy, or when a mapping script gets to your little corner of the expanse and 
you're inundated with probe messages, or whatever.
<p>

Simply check the boxes of the types of mails you want to delete, then click the Clear 
Selected Messages button.
<p>

<h3>Subject Filter</h3>
You can further filter the mail to be deleted by entering a subject.<br>
A common case is when you want to delete excavator emails, but only the "Excavator 
Deployed" mails (you want to keep the "Excavator Results" mails, which tell you which 
planets are getting low on excavators and need more).<br>
In this case, you'd check the Excavators checkbox, then type "Excavator Deployed" in the 
subject box to delete only those Excavator messages.<br>
Additionally, you can use the <b>%</b> sign as a wildcard.  So, instead of typing out 
"Excavator Deployed", you could type simply "<b>%</b> Deployed".<br>
The subject line filter is case-<b>in</b>sensitive, so "<b>%</b> <b>d</b>eployed" would 
work as well as "<b>%</b> <b>D</b>eployed".

<h2>Send Intra-Alliance Mail</h2>
This allows you to send mail to members of your alliance, either to the entire alliance or 
to select members.  Choose as many recipients as you wish from the drop-down box, then 
enter your desired Subject and Body and click Send.
<p>

If you accidentally chose a recipient you didn't mean to, just click the Clear button next 
to the To: field and start over.
<p>

Note that mail sent from this form is bypassing the sometimes overzealous in-game 
profanity filter, which is why the form can only be used to send mail to your alliance 
members.
<p>

Even though it's restricted to alliance members, keep in mind that your alliance may have 
members who don't appreciate a mailbox full of profanity.  So say what you need to say, 
but use some judgement, and be aware of who's on your recipients list.
