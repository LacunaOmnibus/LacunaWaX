<h1>Tools... Mail</h1>

This option will be disabled until you have connected to a game server.

<h2>Clear Mail</h2>
This allows you to clear excess messages from your Inbox.
<p>

If you click multiple Tag checkboxes ("Alert", "Attack", etc) and leave the "Containing 
Subject" box blank, all mail with each of those checked tags will be deleted.
<p>

If you also fill out the "Containing Subject" box, messages matching your checked tags 
that also contain that subject line you typed will be deleted.
<p>

You can use the '%' symbol as a wildcard in the subject.  If you type "Excavator 
De<b>%</b>", and click the "Excavators" checkbox, then all "Excavator Deployed" messages 
will be deleted, but "Excavator Results" messages will remain.
<p>

<h2>Send Intra-Alliance Mail</h2>
This allows you to send mail to members of your alliance, either to the entire alliance or 
to select members.  Choose as many recipients as you wish from the drop-down box, then 
enter your desired Subject and Body and click Send.
<p>

If you accidentally chose a recipient you didn't mean to, just click the Clear button next 
to the To: field and start over.
<p>

Note that mail sent from this form is bypassing the sometimes overzealous in-game 
profanity filter, which is why the form can only be used to send mail to your alliance 
members.
<p>

Even though it's restricted to alliance members, keep in mind that your alliance may have 
members who don't appreciate a mailbox full of profanity.  So say what you need to say, 
but use some judgement, and be aware of who's on your recipients list.
