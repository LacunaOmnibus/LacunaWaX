<h2>Clear Junk Mail</h2>
To clear out excess mail, check the boxes next to each category ("Tag") of mail you want 
to delete, then click the "Clear Selected Messages" button.
<p>

If you want to be more selective about what messages to clear out, eg you want to clear 
all Parliament messages that tell you about a proposition that's been passed:

<ul>
    <li>Click the Parliament checkbox</li>
    <li>
        In the "Containing subject" text box, type the subject line you want to delete.  
        in this case, we want to delete all Parliament messages that start with "Pass:".  
        So, in that text box, type "Pass:%".  The <b>%</b> is a wildcard, meaning it'll 
        match anything that comes after the word "Pass:".
    </li>
    <li>Click the "Clear Selected Messages" button.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Send Intra-Alliance Mail</h2>
This allows you to send mail to members of your alliance, either to the entire alliance or 
to select members.  Choose as many recipients as you wish from the drop-down box, then 
enter your desired Subject and Body and click Send.
<p>

If you accidentally chose a recipient you didn't mean to, just click the Clear button next 
to the To: field and start over.
<p>

Note that mail sent from this form is bypassing the sometimes overzealous in-game 
profanity filter, which is why the form can only be used to send mail to your alliance 
members.
<p>

Even though it's restricted to alliance members, keep in mind that your alliance may have 
members who don't appreciate a mailbox full of profanity.  So say what you need to say, 
but use some judgement, and be aware of who's on your recipients list.
