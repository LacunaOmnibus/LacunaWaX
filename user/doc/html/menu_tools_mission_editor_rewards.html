<h1>Mission Editor Rewards</h1>

This is the list of rewards that will be provided to the user upon completion of the 
mission.
<p>

If you're including ships as mission rewards, note that the numeric inputs allow you to 
specify ship qualities that are better than the current in-game maximums.  Use these 
sparingly.
<p>

If you do want to create a mission whose reward is some sort of super ship, be sure to 
give your reward ship a name (a smuggler with extra speed might be the "Century Hawk").
