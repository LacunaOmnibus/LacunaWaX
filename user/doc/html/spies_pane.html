<h1>Spies Screen</h1>

Here you can rename your spies either individually or in bulk.  You can also set up how 
you'd like your spies to be trained by <code>Schedule_train_spies.exe</code>.
<p>

<h2>Spy Training Preferences</h2>

This can be mildly confusing.  The first section of this screen allows you to assign the 
type of training you want each spy to undergo.  But you can have up to 90 spies per 
planet, and assigning each one individually on all of your planets would be awful and 
tedious.
<p>

The dropdown boxes at the top of the section are meant to alleviate most of that tedium.  
When you select a type of training in the first dropdown box, all of your spies who:
<ul>
    <li>are currently not assigned to anything</li>
    <li>are not maxed out in that training type</li>
</ul>
will be assigned to train in that skill.
<p>

If you had spies who <em>were</em> maxed out in that first skill, you can move on to the 
second dropdown box and select a different skill there.  It will assign spies using the 
same constraints as the first box.
<p>

If you don't like your current assignments, you can clear all of them and start over again 
with the "Clear Spy Assignments" button.
<p>

<strong>Important</strong> - The maximum score a spy can have in any skill is 2600.  If 
you've assigned a spy to be trained in (eg) Intel, and he eventually reaches the maximum 
score, <em>he will remain assigned to train in Intel until you return to this screen and 
re-assign him!</em>  So come back here periodically to make sure your spies are not 
languishing.
<p>

<strong>Also Important</strong> - After setting your spy assignments, don't forget to go 
click the "Save Spy Assignments" button at the bottom of the section.  You'll probably 
need to scroll down to see the button.
<p>

Requires running of <code>Schedule_train_spies.exe</code> to actually do anything.
<p>

<h2>Renaming Spies</h2>

You can rename any spy individually by simply clicking on his current name and typing a 
new name in the text box that appears.  Rename as many spies as you want, then click the 
"Rename Spies" button at the bottom.
<p>

Alternately, you can rename all of your spies at once using the Batch Rename form at the 
very bottom of the screen.
<p>

To perform a batch rename, first type a "name root" in the text box.  Next, chose whether 
you want to tack on a prefix or suffix per spy.
<p>

<strong>Example Prefix</strong> - If you enter a "name root" of "Bond", and chose to use a 
prefix, all of your spies will be named "1 Bond", "2 Bond" .. "90 Bond".
<p>

<strong>Example Suffix</strong> - If you chose suffix instead of prefix, your spies will 
be named "Bond 1", "Bond 2" ...  "Bond 90".
<p>

<strong>Example None</strong> - If you chose "None" (no prefix or suffix), all of your 
spies will be named simply "Bond".  Multiple spies with the same name is legal to the 
game, but might be somewhat confusing to you, so this is not recommended.
<p>
