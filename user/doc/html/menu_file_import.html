<h1>File... Import Preferences</h1>

Imports preferences and settings from an outside LacunaWaX database.
<p>

This allows you to pull in your previous settings if you've recently upgraded to a new 
version of LacunaWaX, or import from a backup in case your current database gets 
corrupted.
<p>

The main LacunaWaX database is a file called <code>lacuna_app.sqlite</code>, and it lives 
in the <code>user/</code> directory (folder).  So with an installer version of LacunaWaX 
on Windows, you'd be looking for something like <code>C:\Program Files\TMT 
Tools\LacunaWaX\user\lacuna_app.sqlite</code>.
