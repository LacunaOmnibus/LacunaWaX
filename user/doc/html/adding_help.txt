You may add new help files or edit the existing ones as you like.

To get your edits to show up in the search index, simply delete the html.idx/ 
directory entirely.  The next time Help is accessed from the app, the index will 
be rebuilt to include your changes.

All help files must appear in this directory.  Do not create subdirectories 
containing help documents.  You will be able to link to those nested documents, 
but they will never appear in search results.



HTML help files will be wrapped by the header and footer in ./wrapper, so do not 
include the beginning and ending HTML found in that file in your help files.

DO include an H1 tag in your help files; the contents of that tag will become 
the page's title.
