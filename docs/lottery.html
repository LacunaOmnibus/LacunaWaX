        <h2>Scheduling the Lottery</h2>

        <h3>Setting up preferences</h3>
        To set up a lottery schedule, you must make sure that you haven't played in the 
        last 24 hours. The setup screen asks the server for the current lottery links, and 
        if you've clicked those links in-game already, they won't be available.
        <p>

        Start LacunaWaX, choose a planet that has an Entertainment District on it, and 
        expand it in the tree on the left. Click the Lottery leaf.
        <p>

        Enter the number of links you want to play the lottery on this planet, and 
        click the Assign button. If you break your 15 lottery plays up over several 
        planets in different zones, repeat the process for your other planets.
        <p>

        If you mess anything up, just click the "Clear all assignments" button on any 
        of the Lottery screens and start over.
        <p>
    
        <h3>LacunaWaX Lottery Links</h3>
        The links displayed on the Lottery screen within LacunaWaX go directly to the 
        voting sites - they do not play the lottery for you! This means that you can 
        safely click on them any time you want to.
        <p>

        Please do click those links periodically, and go actually vote up TLE on those 
        voting sites.
        <p>

        Having the lottery scheduled is convenient from the player's point of view, but it 
        means you'll never actually be visiting those voting sites, which is bad from the 
        game's point of view.
        <p>

        So please do help the game out by going and voting on those sites as often as 
        possible.
        <p>

        <h3>Setting up the schedule</h3>
        You can only click lottery links once every 24 hours. This means you must set your 
        lottery scheduler to run twice per day. If it only ran once per day, you'd get 
        this:
        <p>

        <ul>
            <li>Day 1 - The lottery links are all clicked by the scheduled task.</li>
            <li>
                Day 2 - The scheduled task runs just a hair quicker than it did yesterday, 
                which means it runs in just less than 24 hours from the previous run.  
                Since you're still within the 24 hour window, the lottery does not get 
                played today at all!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        So set it up to run every 12 hours.
