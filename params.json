Barton (tmtowtdi@gmail.com)\r\n\r\nSee NOTES for developer notes.\r\n\r\nSTATUS\r\n------\r\nInstalling and running the executable on Windows is reasonably straightforward and stable.\r\n\r\nRunning from source takes a bit of tweaking.\r\n\r\nCAUTION\r\n-------\r\n\r\nLacunaWaX stores game account passwords in plain text.  Guard your lacuna\\_app.sqlite file \r\n\\- handing it to someone else for any reason is the same as handing that person not only \r\nyour own account password, but also all of your recorded sitter passwords.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to send your lacuna\\_log.sqlite file to someone else for debugging help if \r\nneeded, as it contains no passwords.\r\n\r\nRUNNING FROM SOURCE\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nQuite a few non-core Perl modules are required, and no make process exists yet, so \r\npre-requisite modules will need to be installed manually.\r\n\r\n### REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nThis list is not yet exhaustive.\r\n\r\n* Perl >= v5.14\r\n* Archive::Zip\r\n* Bread::Board\r\n* CHI\r\n* DateTime\r\n* File::Which\r\n* LWP::UserAgent\r\n* Moose\r\n* MooseX::NonMoose\r\n* Try::Tiny\r\n* URI\r\n* Wx\r\n\r\n### Run\r\n    $ perl bin/LacunaWaX.pl\r\n\r\nInstall any modules it complains about missing, and add them to the list above.\r\n\r\nOnce all pre-reqs have been installed, that command will start the GUI.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-298531-10","note":"Don't delete this file!
