<h2>INSTALLING</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        To install on Windows, download the EXE installer and run it.
    </li>
    <li>
        To install on anything other than Windows, you'll need to run from source, 
        which takes a bit more work.  Reasonable installation docs for running from 
        source are on the TODO list.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>UPGRADING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS</h2>
Usually, when you want to upgrade from an old version to a new version, all you need to do 
is run the new version's installer.  You should not need to uninstall the old version 
first; the new version will just lay itself over top of the old version and preserve all 
of your preferences.
<p>
<p>

However, a few people have occasionally had problems when installing a new version over 
top of a much older version (not just the previously-released version).
<p>

When this happens, the install will look like it worked fine, but when you start the 
program and try to access a panel, often one that previously worked, the entire program 
will crash instead.
<p>

If that happens, the solution is to:
<ul>
    <li>
        If you need to record any data from your old version (like lists of sitter 
        passwords), re-install the old version, run the program, and make notes of what 
        you need to preserve.  When you're finished, shut down LacunaWaX.
    </li>
    <li>
        Uninstall LacunaWaX.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fully delete the install directory, which will be in your Program Files directory.  
        The directory (folder) you want to install is "TMT Tools\LacunaWaX" - just delete 
        the whole thing.
    </li>
    <li>
        Now install the new version.  It should work fine now, you'll just need to re-set 
        your preferences.
    </li>
</ul>



<h2>CAUTION</h2>

<p>LacunaWaX stores game account passwords in plain text.  Guard your lacuna_app.sqlite file 
- handing it to someone else for any reason is the same as handing that person not only 
  your own account password, but also all of your recorded sitter passwords.</p>

<p>It is safe to send your lacuna_log.sqlite file to someone else for debugging help if 
needed, as it contains no passwords.</p>

<h2>RUNNING FROM SOURCE</h2>

<p>Quite a few non-core Perl modules are required, and no make process exists yet, so 
pre-requisite modules will need to be installed manually.</p>

        <h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>

        <p>This list is not yet exhaustive.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Perl &gt;= v5.14</li>
        <li>Archive::Zip</li>
        <li>Bread::Board</li>
        <li>CHI</li>
        <li>DateTime</li>
        <li>File::Which</li>
        <li>LWP::UserAgent</li>
        <li>Moose</li>
        <li>MooseX::NonMoose</li>
        <li>Try::Tiny</li>
        <li>URI</li>
        <li>Wx</li>
        </ul><h3>Run</h3>

        <pre><code>$ perl bin/LacunaWaX.pl
        </code></pre>

        <p>Install any modules it complains about missing, and add them to the list above.</p>

        <p>Once all pre-reqs have been installed, that command will start the GUI.</p>
