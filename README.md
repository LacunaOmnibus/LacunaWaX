A GUI for The Lacuna Expanse

Copyright 2012-2015 Jonathan D. Barton (tmtowtdi@gmail.com) 

TBD
------
- Adding sitters breaks.  See TC's comment in the MontyLacuna (for whatever 
  reason) gitter.
  - Fixed
- Have another look at the stations screen again - "seized X of Y" -- get rid 
  of that.  Maybe just display total influence.
  - Fixed

CAUTION
-------
LacunaWaX stores game account passwords in plain text.  Guard your lacuna\_app.sqlite file \- handing it to someone else for any reason is the same as handing that person not only your own account password, but also all of your recorded sitter passwords.

It is safe to send your lacuna\_log.sqlite file to someone else for debugging help if needed, as it contains no passwords.
