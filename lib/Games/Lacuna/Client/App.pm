This originally used read_yaml from Util.pm.  However, the only version that 
gives over YAML::XS::LoadFile is the modification of datetime strings to 
DateTime objects.  Our main config file has none of those.

The enormous disadvantage to using read_yaml is that it lives in Util, which 
meant we had to have Util loaded to read the prefs file which here we were 
trying to use to load Util.  Circular logic no worky-worky because circular 
logic no worky-worky because (you get the idea).

Use this to make all remote calls.  If an RPC error is encountered, it will be 
handled if possible.  If the error cannot be handled gracefully, the error 
will be logged and this will croak.

Keep in mind that this module and its objects inherit from Games::Lacuna::Client, 
so if the object you need to call a method on is a client object, send your $lc 
object.  It may look a little unusual.

 my $planet = $client->body(id => $body_id);
becomes
 my $planet = $lc->call( $lc, 'body', [id => $body_id] );

 my $blgs = $planet->get_buildings();

You must run this from the CLI.  If you try to run it through Gvim, the captcha 
won't work, but this sub will notice what you're doing and die with a reminder 
that yer doin it rong.

The captcha image itself pops up rather rudely, using whatever your default .png 
viewer on the system is.  You need to Alt-Tab or otherwise go back to the CLI 
window and enter the solution to the captcha there.

This is rather ugly, but it does clean up after itself.  And once a single 
captcha is solved, you are assumed to be sitting in front of the computer for 
the next 30 minutes, so your program is then free to do things like assign jobs 
to spies.

Although it certainly involves hitting the server, this does not use any RPC 
calls, succeed or fail.

 $all_buildings = $lt->get_buildings($planet_id);
 $space_ports   = $lt->get_buildings($planet_id, 'Space Port');

Returns an arrayref containing a list of building objects matching your request.

If 'building_type' is sent, it's checked as an exact match (eq) against the 
building's "Human Readable Name" (the one you see when you mouse-over the 
building in the game client) and also as a ci (//i) match against the 
building's "internal" name.  eg the internal name for the "Hydrocarbon Energy 
Plant" is 'HydroCarbon'.

This allows you to request buildings with similar names:

 $trainers = $lt->get_buildings($planet_id, 'TrAiNiNg');
 $trainers = $lt->get_buildings($planet_id, 'training');

...Those two calls are identical; in each case $trainers contains all of the 
buildings with 'training' in their internal name; this will include all four 
types of spy training building.  It'll also contain the pilot training 
facility, so you do still need to check each building to make sure it's 
reasonable for what you need it for.

DEPRECATED - like get_buildings, having this here is stupid.  Use the one in Planet.pm.

First, get a space port object
 my $space_port = $self->get_buildings($body_id, 'Space Port')->[0];


Then, get all ships at that port
 my $all_ships = $self->get_ships($space_port);

Or, get all instances of a specific type of ship at that port.  (Case-insensitive)
 my $all_scows = $self->get_ships($space_port, 'scow');

Or, get a type of ship currently performing any of a list of tasks.  Valid 
tasks are Docked, Building, Mining, Travelling, and Defend.
 my $docked_scows = $self->get_ships($space_port, 'scow', ['Docked']);

That last one is likely the one you're going to want to use most often.

Returns the name of a planet's star, as long as load_planets.pl was run when

$planet_id here must be the ID from the game server.  I store this as 
Planets.game_id, NOT Planets.id.

The star name is being pulled from the database, every time, so this never uses
any RPCs.

Many of the other methods allow the 'planet' arg to be either a planet name or 
a planet ID; that only works for planets in your own empire.  This method 
returns the star name of any planet (if known), not just planets in your empire.

The upshot here is that the first arg to this must be the planet's ID, never its 
name.

=head2 get_travel_time

Given an origin, a target, and a ship speed, returns two L<DateTime::Duration> 
objects indicating 1) the amount of time to get from point A to point B at the 
given speed and 2) the amount of time represented by a single unit of speed at 
that distance.

 $origin = 'my_planet';
 $target = 'enemy_planet';
 ($dur, $diff) = $lt->get_travel_time( $origin, $target, $speed );

$target may now be either:
    - A string, the name of the planet (requires the destination be in the 
      Planets table, meaning it must have been probed)
    - A hashref, containing the keys 'x' and 'y', being the destination coords; 
      this does not require the destination to have been previously probed.

Your best bet is to use L<DateTime::Format::Duration> to view the returned data:

 my $formatter = DateTime::Format::Duration->new(
  normalize => 1,
  pattern => '%e days, %H hours, %M minutes, %S seconds'
 );

 say $formatter->format_duration($dur) . " from $origin to $target with a ship of speed $speed.";
 say "At this distance, each point of speed represents " . $formatter->format_duration($diff);

Both the $origin and $target args can be either planet names or IDs.  If 
either $origin or $target is not found in the Planets table, this will die.

Inserts a new or updates an existing Planets record into our local database.  
Links the Planets record with the appropriate Empires record, which is also 
created if needed.

If that Empire is in an alliance, and no appropriate record exists in the 
Alliances table, that will be inserted as well.  If the alliance's name has 
changed, the new name will be updated, though no other changed alliance data
will be updated (eg a changed leader_id).

The $body hashref arg is recommended to be something that came from the game, 
eg you've pulled a star hashref with get_stars() and then pulled its orbiting 
bodies as hashrefs.

Returns a hashref of available (Docked) excavators for $planet.  The hashref is 
of the format:

Returning the Space Port object as well as the excavators will save us from

Pulls data from a box on the starmap.  The square is defined by ($x1, $y1) as 
the upper left corner and ($x2, $y2) as the lower right corner of the box.

If you want to target a single specific star, you can simply send that star's
coords as both pairs:

 my $rv = $lt->record_map_square(
  -175, 163,    # Glee Atiogg
  -175, 163,    # Glee Atiogg
 );

Maximum size for the box (limited by the game, not by this module) is 900 
units, so a 30x30 square would be common, but you could grab a 10x90 rectangle 
if you wanted.

Every star in the requested area that has been probed by either you or another 
member of your alliance will cause records to be created and updated for every 
body orbiting that star.  This includes entries for any inhabiting empires and 
any alliances of which they may be members.

=pod

Returns RPCs used by the current GLCT object, either incremental or full.  By 
default it returns the full number used since object creation.  If a single true 
argument is sent, only the count of RPCs since the last call to rpc_elapsed will 
be returned.

Note that "the full number used since object creation" means the number of RPCs
used /by your account/, not necessarily by this object.

ie if you have the web client open in your browser and perform several actions 
there at the same time you have a script running, the script's rpc_elapsed() 
count will include the RPCs used by your actions in the browser.


Keep in mind that this call itself uses an RPC and that used RPC will be 
included in the count returned.  If you want to display the number of RPCs used 
by a specific method, remember to subtract 1 from the integer returned by this:

 say $lt->rpc_count;    # 10 (for eg)

 $lt->method_that_uses_one_rpc();
 say $lt->rpc_elapsed(1) . " RPCs used";    # 2

 $lt->method_that_uses_one_rpc();
 say $lt->rpc_elapsed(1) . " RPCs used";    # 2

 say $lt->rpc_elapsed . " RPCs used";       # 15 (10 + 2 + 2 + 1)

=pod

Creates and returns a general Log::Dispatch logger object that can be used by 
anything that wants a logging facility.

This is called automatically when you create you GLCT object; you never need 
to explicitly call this method.  However, you're welcome to call it any time 
you wish to modify the logger's settings.

Log to a file
 $lt->log_file('/path/to/my/logfile.log');
 $lt->set_logger();

Log just to the screen, turn off file logging.
 $lt->log_file('');
 $lt->log_screen(1);
 $lt->set_logger();


Change the file's minimum logging level down to 'debug'
 $lt->set_logger({ file_min_level => 'debug' });

Change the screens's minimum logging level up to 'info' - this can be quite 
useful, as the default screen level is 'debug' and I can be a little heavy-
handed with the debug-level logging events sometimes.
 $lt->set_logger({ screen_min_level => 'info' });

By default, the file's log level will be set at 'info', and the screen's log 
level will be set to 'debug'.


Calling this with no outputs defined will not produce an error.  It will produce 
a Log::Dispatch object with NO OUTPUT STREAMS DEFINED.  This means that any 
logging you do will simply be tossed into /dev/null.

 $lt->log_file('');
 $lt->log_file(0);
 $lt->set_logger();
 $lt->log->emergency("Computer on fire!");   # nobody will ever see this.


Available logging levels in order:
 debug
 info
 notice
 warning
 error
 critical
 alert
