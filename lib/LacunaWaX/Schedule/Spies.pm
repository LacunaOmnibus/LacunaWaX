If no training buildings exist on the planet, returns undef.

=head2 Memoizing Spies

$spy_training_building->view->{'spies'}{'training_costs'}{'time'} returns a list 
of spies who are available to be trained by that $spy_training_building.

This list excludes spies who are on cooldown from a mission, and spies who are 
already being trained.

The list includes spies who are Idle (good), but it also includes spies who are 
on Counter Espionage (what?!?  why?)

Now, I don't want to train spies who've been set to Counter - if the user set a 
defensive spy on Counter, he's supposed to stay that way, protecting the planet, 
not heading off to training.


The problem here is that $spy_training_building->view does not tell you what the 
spy is currently assigned to - you can't tell if he's idle or on counter from 
that data (what?!? why not?)


SO, to determine whether a given 'available to train' spy is actually Idle or on 
Counter, we have to:
    - Get that spy's home Int Min (the $spy_training_building->view does include 
      the spy's home planet ID, which makes getting the Int Min a little easier)
    - Get a list of all of that Int Min's spies
        - This list contains much more info on the spies, including their 
          current assignement.
    - Dig the current spy out of that list, and look at his assignment.  It'll 
      be either 'Idle' or 'Counter Espionage'.
    - If that spy is not listed as 'Idle', do not try to train him.


The first two steps of that are going to be expensive server calls.  Since we're 
currently in a scheduled task, the Bread::Board container does not have a CHI 
object in it.

So, rather than using CHI, I'm memoizing the get_int_min() and get_spies() subs 
(not methods!) below.  The first call to those two subs takes about 8 seconds; 
subsequent calls with the same args are about instantaneous.
