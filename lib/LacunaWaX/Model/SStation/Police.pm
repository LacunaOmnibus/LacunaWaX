Returns true if there are any spies onsite not set to Counter Espionage.

view_foreign_spies() gives each spy's name, task, level, and time to next 
mission.  It does not report the spy's owner, or if he's a friendly or not.

So the best logic we can go with is, if there's a spy on a SS who's not set to 
Counter Espionage, he's likely a problem.

Only detects spies whose level is < the police station's level.

Unlike incoming_hostiles, there _is_ a reasonable chance, as when the station 
is under attack, that there will be more than 25 defending spies taking up the 
entire first page of results.  So this does page all the way through all spies 
onsite.

CHECK that's completely untested; I have no SSs with > 25 spies, and none with 
any hostiles (that I know of).

If there are incoming ships, checks to see if the sending empire is a member 
of the current user's alliance.  If not, the ship is hostile and a true value 
is returned.  If no or only allied ships are incoming, returns false.

Note that this will only check the first page of incoming ships.  The chances 
of 25 allied ships heading in and taking up the entire first page, to be 
followed on subsequent pages by hostile ships, is so low that I'm not going to 
bother trying to page through all of the results.
