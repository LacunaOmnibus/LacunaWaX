Returns a hashref containing, at least, the ID of the target, and possibly also 
its name:

 {
    id   => 123456,
    name => 'Some planet name',
 }

If the user supplied the target ID on the form, then /only/ the ID will be 
included in the returned hashref.

If the user supplied star name and orbit, the target name will be included as 
well.



Given the star name and orbit, I can get rudimentary info on the planet at that 
orbit.

But using planet (target) ID instead of star name and orbit, where possible, is 
preferred.  This is to keep users from being lazy and just repeatedly firing at 
the same star, same orbit, without checking - if the target gets moved by a BHG 
to another orbit, being lazy like that can result in accidentally firing at an 
alliance member.

However, given a body object created just by ID, as when given a target ID, I am 
unable to get any information at all on that body, unless it's a body I own - 
body->get_status returns "1002: That body does not exist" (or similar) for 
foreign bodies.  I can't even get the name of the orbited star given just the 
planet ID.  

So I'd really like it if this method could return the target planet name, but 
it's only able to do so if the user supplied the (less preferred) star name and 
orbit rather than the target body ID.

I guess I understand that; you could conceivably write a script that just 
iterates from 1 .. $big_integer to grab bodies and then derive info from that, 
without ever having to probe them.
