If any of the listed bodies are new, they're probably space stations.  For this program to be able recognize the difference between a space station and a planet, you have to double-click the station's name on the left there. \n
Doing so will let LacunaWaX figure out whether the new body is a station or not.  You only need to do this one time per new station - once you've done it once, LacunaWaX will remember that it's a station.\n";
