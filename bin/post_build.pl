As part of Cava's build process, it copies everything in ROOT/user to 
ROOT/Cava/release/LacunaWaX/user/.  This includes the live databases you're 
using if you're running the program from source, and these databases include 
your login credentials and logs as well as all of your preferences.

We don't want to install our personal databases into a new install, so this 
deletes those from the release directory.
