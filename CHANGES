    - RearrangerPane
        - This is honestly still quite a mess.  It works fine, but the code 
            could use some cleanup.

    - Orbit Calculator
        - Given (x,y) coords, assume those coords are of a star, and derive 
            the coords of its 8 orbits
        - In fact, we should be able to check the database to ensure that 
            it's a star (but I'd have to deliver a stars table for that.)

    - Mutex
        - KC just got a hung lock - when looking for locks, we should be 
            taking the age of the lockfile into account (or something)
        - Better bet might be:
            - When creating a lockfile, also create a separate .pid file, 
                and destroy that .pid file when destroying the lockfile.
                - Or just write the pid into the lockfile itself
            - Either way, when we try to get a lock and find one already in 
                existence
                - Check to see if the pid from the file is still running.  
                    If not, delete the lock file (and .pid file if there is 
                    one) and continue.

    - The Glyphs ImageList builder (as well as the warship one, which isn't 
        being used right now), lives in the LacunaWaX package, which I don't 
        think I like.
        - Maybe a LacunaWaX::Gui::Util package (or something) is needed.

    - All the assets are currently individual files, which need to be 
        extracted on every install
        - Jam them all into a .zip file or some such and have the 
            WxContainer pull them out.  ->resolve('image') should still end up 
            working the same way.

    - Fonts
        - This works to display a specific font, but that font must already 
            be installed on the user's system.

                service 'header_1' => (
                    block => sub {
                        my $font_name = 'Everson Mono Unicode';
                        my $f = Wx::Font->new(
                            24,
                            wxFONTFAMILY_MODERN, 
                            wxFONTSTYLE_NORMAL, 
                            wxFONTWEIGHT_BOLD, 
                            0,
                            $font_name,
                            wxFONTENCODING_DEFAULT,
                        );
                    }
                );

    - Sizers
        - All sizers being built in modules implementing the GuiElement role 
            should be calling its build_sizer for both convenience and 
            conformity.
            - This has mostly been done, but I need to comb the code to see 
                if there's any refugee code still creating its own sizers.

    - Left-hand (bodies) tree
        - Add a scrollbar
            - Scrolling with the mousewheel works on Windows, but not Linux.  
                The scrollbar does automatically appear on Windows as things 
                stand right now.

    - Add a time/distance calculator tool.
        - Lower priority now that carbonhalo's app exists

    - think about removing the required db_file and db_log_file args to 
        Container.pm
        - It's already getting root_dir, and we know where those two files 
            are relative to that.
        - Though as-is isn't hurting anything so this is lowish priority.

    - Fix all catch blocks following an attempt to query the game server so 
        they resemble the catch block in 
        MainSplitterWindow/RightPane/PropositionsPane.pm in sub _build_props.
        This allows us to properly deal with 'malformed JSON string' messages, 
        in which the error string comes back fully in $_ rather than as an 
        Exception object.
        - It would be nice if GLClient.pm handled this so I don't have to go 
            edit all of my catch blocks.
            catch {
            my $msg = (ref $_) ? $_->text : $_;
            poperr($msg)....
            }

    COMPLETED FEATURES:
        - Added mail tool, including inbox cleaner and inter-alliance

    INTERNAL CHANGES:
        - Moved creation of About dialog into MenuBar::Help from 
            LacunaWaX.pm (where it didn't make any sense).

1.6.4   (tagged 04/04/2013) {#{{{

    - Bugfix release
        - Spies set to the Counter Espionage mission will no longer be 
            trained by Schedule_train_spies
            
}#}}}
1.6.2   (tagged 04/01/2013) {#{{{

    - Bugfix release
        - No, it's not an April Fool's joke.

    - COMPLETED FEATURES
        - Individual spy task assigning, which had been broken by the 
            renaming code, has been fixed.
        - Wrapped get_glyph_summary in a try{} block.  Why it wasn't like 
            that already is a mystery.
}#}}}
1.6     (tagged 03/27/2013) {#{{{

    - Scheduled Tasks
        - Make them GUI executables and change any docs relating to creating 
            a new windows user AND add a link to the free System Scheduler so 
            people don't have to deal with the shitty built-in Windows 
            scheduler.
        - I've switched .exe types; test a good bit before making this 
            permanent.
            - Does not work.  But the 3rd-party System Scheduler does have a 
                'run hidden' option, so leaving them as CLI executables is 
                fine as long as that option is selected.
            - I added a walkthrough on using System Scheduler, with 
                screenshots, at the same time I uploaded v1.6 to the website.

    - COMPLETED FEATURES
        - Individual renaming of spies
        - Batch renaming of spies
        - The tree in the left pane can now be fully collapsed or expanded by double-clicking the Bodies leaf
}#}}}
1.4     (tagged 03/12/2013) {#{{{
    - FIXED BUGS
        - Fixed funky re-display of intro panel after editing preferences
        - Fixed explosion due to unicode characters in body names.
        - Didn't fix the voting stall, but stopped it from locking up the program.
        - Fixed the crash on the GlyphsPane when closing the glyph-cooking 
            status window
        - Fixed funky StatusDialog layout on Ubuntu

    - COMPLETED FEATURES
        - Added Fire BFG form to stations >= level 25
        - Sitter Voting ceases if the user closes the Status dialog window.
        - Same with Glyph cooking
}#}}}
1.2     (tagged 02/27/2013) {#{{{
    - FIXED BUGS
        - Off-by-one error when pushing sitter votes
        - Glyph home planet was only allowing lower-case planet names
        - Clicking Spies leaf for a planet with no Int Min was doing nothing 
            and giving no feedback. Now provides popmsg.

    - COMPLETED FEATURES
        - Scrollbars now work (MorL) as expected
        - Text cleanup (nicer font sizes, removal of excess whitespace)
        - Added Build All Halls button to Glyphs screen
        - Added owner name to body summary screen
        - Added Clear Spy Assignments button so Spies screen
        - Sitter Password Manager
        - Instructions added to Spy Training screen to make the Skill 
            drop-downs up top make more sense.
        - Remove references to ThrobberFrame
        - Glyph pusher (to each non-SS)
}#}}}
1.0     (tagged) {#{{{
    - Added rpc_sleep attribute to LacunaWaX::Client to pass along to 
        GLClient, which already had it.
    - Break all individual classes out to their own files.
    - Rename MyClient to something non-stupid, and fix all calls.
    - Test my version of RPC.pm (Games::Lacuna::Client::TMTRPC.pm)
        - I should be able to make calls to that without farting around with 
            MyClient::call().  If that works properly, fix all calls and get 
            rid of MyClient::call().
        - This appears to be working, and quite a bit faster than when I was 
            using my call() version.
