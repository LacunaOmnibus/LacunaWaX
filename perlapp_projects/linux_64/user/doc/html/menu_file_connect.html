<h1>File... Connect</h1>

Connects you to one of the two game servers.  Only servers for which you've entered 
credentials in <a href="menu_edit_preferences.html">Edit... Preferences</a> will be 
enabled.
<p>

If you're already connected to one server, you can switch to the other this way.
<p>

However, connecting this way will not refresh your credentials!  Generally you'll probably 
use your sitter password to connect.  If you decide you want to fire the BFG, you'll need 
to use your full password.  Changing your password in Preferences to your full, and then 
re-connecting using File... Connect will <em>not</em> connect you using your full 
password.  You'll need to close and re-start LacunaWaX to use your newly-entered 
credentials.
