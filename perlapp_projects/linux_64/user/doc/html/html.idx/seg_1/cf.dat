One of the main benefits of LacunaWaX is that it allows you to schedule a number of common 
tasks.  You set up what you want those scheduled tasks to do using the main LacunaWaX GUI, 
but LacunaWaX itself does not schedule anything; you must set up your own schedule.


Schedule-able programs are found in [% bin_dir %], and include:

    
        Schedule_archmin.exe
        
            Handles both glyph pushing and automated searching of individual arch 
            mins

            Plays the lottery on your requested colonies
        
    
    
        Schedule_train_spies.exe
        
            Trains spies in the skills you've chosen provided the spies are both available 
            and currently sitting on a planet with the appropriate training building
        
    


Actually setting up the schedule (Windows)

You can use the built-in Windows Task Scheduler if you want to, but if you're not used to 
it, it can be a horror show to try to figure out.


Instead, download and install System 
Scheduler Free from Splinterware.  It's easier to use than the Windows scheduler and 
it will look the same across different versions of Windows, so you can just follow the 
instructions below step-by-step.


Preferences



After installing System Scheduler, you'll have a little alarm clock icon in 
your system tray (next to your clock).  Right-click it and chose 
"Preferences", then chose the Startup/Logging tab.


Make sure the "Do NOT start System Scheduler automatically on logon" checkbox 
is unchecked!  After you've made sure of that, you can close the 
preferences window.




Create new event



Go back to the alarm clock icon in your systray again and just double-(left)-click it to 
bring up the actual scheduler.


You can see I have my Arch Min and Spy Training already set up, but I don't have Autovote 
set yet.  To set that up, click the indicated green circle icon to create a New Event.



    
Name it and select the program to run



Give your event a title, then click the yellow folder icon next to Application .  
Browse to your TMT Tools/LacunaWaX/bin/ folder and select "Schedule_autovote.exe".




Make sure to run it Hidden



Make sure to select the "Hidden" State.  This will keep the black CMD window from popping 
up at you each time the scheduled event runs.




Choose times for it to run



I want my autovote to run every three hours.  So I selected "Every 
Hour/Selected Minutes" in the dropdown box up top.  Then, in the Hours 
box, I entered:

    00,03,06,09,12,15,18,21

Also, I typed 30 in the Minutes box, so my task will run at 
30 minutes past the hour, every three hours.


If you wanted your task to run every two hours, it would be:

    00,02,04,06,08,10,12,14,16,18,20,22

...etc




Save



Don't forget to save your new scheduled task by clicking the floppy icon.




Done!



And that's it - you can see my new scheduled task has been set up, and it displays the 
time when it'll run next.  You can now just close the System Scheduler window.

Thanks Jazz
I had used Jazz's building mover program quite a bit, and found that I missed being able 
to use it when I switched over to my Ubuntu machine.  So this rearranger screen was the 
first bit of LacunaWaX I created, and draws its layout from Jazz's program.


Rearranging Buildings
Simply click the building you want to move (it will get "picked up"), then click where you 
want to lay it back down again.


If the destination square already contained a building, it will be replaced with the one 
you most recently "picked up", and it will now be the one "picked up".  When all your 
buildings are laid out the way you want them, click the Rearrange button at the bottom.


If you decide that the layout you've been working on is awful and want to start over 
again, click the Reload button to reset everything.


After rearranging your buildings, if you already had that planet open in your browser, 
you'll need to refresh the planet surface in your browser to see the changes.

Viewing this screen requires that the SS have a Parliament of at least level 25.  If it 
does not, no BFG exists, and clicking the BFG leaf in the tree will simply complain and 
then show you the Station's summary screen instead.


Firing the BFG requires that you be logged in with your full password, not your sitter.

Once you're logged in with your full password, enter the name of the Star that 
your target is orbiting, then chose the orbit number of your target .  The 
"reason" text is required, and will be included in the mail that gets sent out to your 
alliance members.  You can keep the default or enter anything you wish.


When you click the red "Open fire!" button, the ID of the target planet will appear in the 
Target Planet ID box.  This is for your convenience; if you plan on firing the BFG 
multiple times, you can just write that number down somewhere.  The next time you want to 
fire the BFG, you can enter that number in the box, and skip the Star Name and Orbit 
inputs.


Also, a confirmation box will pop up asking if you're sure about firing.  So if you're 
just interested in getting the target ID for later, you can click "Open fire!", then 
choose not to actually fire, and you'll still be given the target ID.


That Target Planet ID is for more than just convenience.  During an extended battle, it's 
possible one of your allies might move your target to another orbit for some reason 
(likely an attempt to reduce happiness).  If you're not paying attention, and blindly fire 
the BFG at the same star and same orbit you did yesterday, you could conceivably end up 
firing it at an ally instead of your intended target.


If you use the Target Planet ID instead, that target is what will be in the BFG's 
crosshairs, even if it had been moved.


A legend exists of a certain careless BFG gunman who did exactly what's been described 
above, and shot at one of his own alliance member's colonies.  Learn from that bonehead's 
mistakes.

So when you calculate a distance, the result will be automatically entered into the Distance input of the Time calculator, below.contentì
Tools... Calculator

Halls
Enter the current level of one of your glyph buildings, and the level you want to get it 
up to.  You'll be given the number of halls needed to make the requested upgrade.


Distance from coords
Enter the (x,y) coordinates of any two points (generally you'll use the coordinates of two 
planets, but any two points will work) to get the distance between those two points.


Often, the reason you're calculating a distance in the first place is because you want to 
know how long it will take a given ship to travel between two points.  So when you 
calculate a distance, the result will be automatically entered into the Distance input of 
the Time calculator, below.


Time
Given a distance and a rate of travel (the Speed attribute of the ship you wish to send; 
that Speed attribute can be seen in your Space Port), this gives you the time it will take 
for a ship travelling that speed to cover that distance.


Trilaterate
Occasionally you'll have the name of a planet (possibly from a mail message), but you'll 
have no idea where that planet is.  This calculator allows you to find that planet.


To do this, we need to know how much time it will take for a ship of a known speed to 
reach the target planet; we'll need this information from two of your planets.


So chose two of your planets, preferably two that are as far away from each other as 
possible.


On each of these planets:

    Record the (x,y) coordinates of the planet
    Open one of the Space Ports
    On the Send tab, enter the name of your target planet and click "Get Available 
    Ships For Target"
    Record the speed of your fastest ship, and the time it will take for that ship to 
    reach your target planet.  Record the speed as it's given in-game (eg h:m:s, d:h:m:s, 
    whatever.)



Enter that information into the Trilaterate calculator.  You'll usually be given two 
candidate points; your target planet is at one of those two points.  With the information 
in hand, there's no way to mathematically determine which of those two points is the 
correct location of your target planet, so you'll need to probe both stars.


However, occasionally one of the candidate points will be outside the boundaries of the 
Expanse.  In those cases, the calculator knows for sure that that point cannot be correct.  
if the calculator only provides you with a single candidate point, that's the location of 
your target planet.

But be careful about who you give it to - use your best judgement.

 Start LacunaWaX, choose a planet that has an Entertainment District on it, and expand it in the tree on the left. Click the Lottery leaf.contentè$Lottery Setup

Setting up preferences
To set up a lottery schedule, you must make sure that you haven't played in the last 24 
hours. The setup screen asks the server for the current lottery links, and if you've 
clicked those links in-game already, they won't be available.


Start LacunaWaX, choose a planet that has an Entertainment District on it, and expand it 
in the tree on the left. Click the Lottery leaf.


Enter the number of links you want to play the lottery on this planet, and click the 
Assign button. If you break your 15 lottery plays up over several planets in different 
zones, repeat the process for your other planets.


If you mess anything up, just click the "Clear all assignments" button on any of the 
Lottery screens and start over.


LacunaWaX Lottery Links
The links displayed on the Lottery screen within LacunaWaX go directly to the voting sites 
- they do not play the lottery for you! This means that you can safely click on them any 
time you want to.


Please do click those links periodically, and go actually vote up TLE on those voting 
sites.


Having the lottery scheduled is convenient from the player's point of view, but it means 
you'll never actually be visiting those voting sites, which is bad from the game's point 
of view.


So please do help the game out by going and voting on those sites as often as possible.


Setting up the schedule
You can only click lottery links once every 24 hours. This means you must set your lottery 
scheduler to run twice per day. If it only ran once per day, you'd get this:



    Day 1 - The lottery links are all clicked by the scheduled task.
    
        Day 2 - The scheduled task runs just a hair quicker than it did yesterday, 
        which means it runs in just less than 24 hours from the previous run.  
        Since you're still within the 24 hour window, the lottery does not get 
        played today at all!
    



So set it up to run every 12 hours.

Note that mail sent from this form is bypassing the sometimes overzealous in-game 
profanity filter, which is why the form can only be used to send mail to your alliance 
members.


Even though it's restricted to alliance members, keep in mind that your alliance may have 
members who don't appreciate a mailbox full of profanity.  So say what you need to say, 
but use some judgement, and be aware of who's on your recipients list.

If a planet has been damaged by attack or fissure (or whatever), this pane allows you to 
repair your buildings in bulk, in the order you specify.


Using
The list on the left will show all damaged buildings on the planet.  Most of the time, 
this list will just be empty, which means that none of your buildings are damaged, and 
life is good.


When buildings are listed on the left, you'll want to select the buildings you want to 
repair, and move them to the right-hand list:

    
        You can move a single building by highlighting the building and clicking the 
        > button.
    
    
        You can just move all of your buildings in one shot by clicking the

        button.  Remember that glyph buildings repair free of charge, so you likely want 
        to repair those first.
    
    
        If you accidentally moved buildings that you didn't mean to move over to the 
        right-hand list, you can put them back in the same way with the 
        < and << buttons.
    



Buildings will be repaired in the order they appear in the list on the right side.  Each 
time you add a new building by clicking > , that new building will 
appear at the top of the list on the right .  So, if you want your buildings 
repaired in a specific order, add the ones you want repaired last to the list first.


Once your buildings are all arranged as you want them, click the Repair 
button, and your repairs will begin.  A window will pop up giving you a running commentary 
on what's happening.  If you need to, you can cancel the repairs in progress at any time 
by simply closing that pop up window.


Resources (Important!)
Your current stored resources are shown at the bottom of the screen; those numbers will be 
updated each time you complete a round of repairs.  When you begin repairing a list of 
buildings, all of the buildings in the list will be repaired as much as possible.  If you 
were hit hard (like, by a fissure), you very probably will not have enough resources on 
your planet to be able to repair all of your buildings.


If you try to repair more buildings than you have the resources for, your stored resources 
will be taken almost down to nothing.  If running all the way out of resources is going to 
be a problem, you'll need to be careful about which buildings you add to the "to be 
repaired" list on the right.

This option will be disabled until you have connected to a game server.


This allows you to record any sitter passwords friends and alliance members may have given 
you.


When you enter a new empire name and sitter password, the Add button will automatically 
test the given credentials to make sure they're valid, and then save them if they are.


If a friend has changed their sitter and sends you their new one, you can simply type the 
new sitter in place of the old one and click Update, which will also test the new sitter 
before saving it.


If you've had a sitter in your list for a while and are unsure if it's still valid, you 
can click the Test button, which will simply test the displayed credentials and let you 
know if they're good or not.


The credentials listed here are used by the vote pusher on the Propositions Screen .


Caution - ALL passwords recorded by LacunaWaX need to be passed to the 
game server in plaintext, and they are therefore stored in LacunaWaX's internal database 
in plaintext.  This database is stored on your machine in

    [%user_dir%][%dir_sep%]lacuna_app.sqlite

If you ever send that file to anyone, you're effectively handing them your own login 
credentials along with every sitter you have stored.


So don't do that.

Upon coming back to that page, you should be able to see your edits.contentîNAdding Help Documents

Adding new help documents is easy.  Even if you don't know any HTML, the markup used in 
the help files is very simple, and you should be able to figure it out just by looking at 
what's already there.


All of the pages of this help system are stored on your machine in

    [% html_dir %]


Browse to that directory and edit any of the .html files you find there.  You can edit 
existing help files and see your edits immediately in the Help browser window - browse to 
the page you're editing, make your changes, then click 'back' and then 'forward' again to 
get back to the page on which you're working.  Upon coming back to that page, you should 
be able to see your edits.


If you want to make a new Help file, your best bet is to copy one of the existing ones 
( ss_as_planet.html is probably a good candidate), give your copy a good 
descriptive name (make sure it ends in ".html"), and edit away.


When you're finished editing, link your new help document in index.html where 
ever it makes sense to do so; follow the existing examples.


Make your changes show up in the search index

In that same directory with the help files is a subdirectory (folder) called

    [% lucy_index %]


...that subdirectory is the search index.  Delete it completely .  Then close and 
restart LacunaWaX.  The next time you open the Help browser, that search index will be 
automatically re-created, and will include any edits or new files you just added, so 
searches will turn up your new documents.

"I do know some HTML, and these help files look awfully sparse!"

The help documents themselves are actually templates, and all the standard HTML 
boilerplate header and footer stuff is being dealt with elsewhere.


So most of the Help files consist of a few headers (<h1>, <h2>, etc), some 
paragraph breaks (<p>), the help content itself, and not much else.


You may notice that the help files are not using any CSS, and are using (ack!) font tags 
in a few places.  This is not because I'm a horrible human being.  It's because the HTML 
parser being used in this window is fairly basic, and simply does not understand CSS.

"I've made some updates or edits to help documents.  What now?"

All you need to do now is submit a pull request to the main LacunaWaX github repository .  If 
you're not sure how to do that, you might be able to find a friend or alliance member who 
does know, and just send the help files to them and have them submit the pull request on 
your behalf.  Most alliances have at least one member who can manage that, since it's the 
same way that the alliance logos had to be submitted.

filenamespies_pane.htmltitleSpies ScreensummaryÇ% The dropdown boxes at the top of the section are meant to alleviate most of that tedium. When you select a type of training in the first dropdown box, all of your spies who: are currently not assigned to anythingare not maxed out in that training type will be assigned to train in that skill.contentîHSpies Screen

Here you can rename your spies either individually or in bulk.  You can also set up how 
you'd like your spies to be trained.

Spy Training Preferences

This can be mildly confusing.  The first section of this screen allows you to assign the 
type of training you want each spy to undergo.  But you can have up to 90 spies per 
planet, and assigning each one individually on all of your planets would be awful and 
tedious.


The dropdown boxes at the top of the section are meant to alleviate most of that tedium.  
When you select a type of training in the first dropdown box, all of your spies who:

    are currently not assigned to anything
    are not maxed out in that training type

will be assigned to train in that skill.


If you had spies who were maxed out in that first skill, you can move on to the 
second dropdown box and select a different skill there.  It will assign spies using the 
same constraints as the first box.


If you don't like your current assignments, you can clear all of them and start over again 
with the "Clear Spy Assignments" button.


Important - The maximum score a spy can have in any skill is 2600.  If 
you've assigned a spy to be trained in (eg) Intel, and he eventually reaches the maximum 
score, he will remain assigned to train in Intel until you return to this screen and 
re-assign him!  So come back here periodically to make sure your spies are not 
languishing.


Also Important - After setting your spy assignments, don't forget to go 
click the "Save Spy Assignments" button at the bottom of the section.  You'll probably 
need to scroll down to see the button.


Renaming Spies

You can rename any spy individually by simply clicking on his current name and typing a 
new name in the text box that appears.  Rename as many spies as you want, then click the 
"Rename Spies" button at the bottom.


Alternately, you can rename all of your spies at once using the Batch Rename form at the 
very bottom of the screen.


To perform a batch rename, first type a "name root" in the text box.  Next, chose whether 
you want to tack on a prefix or suffix per spy.


Example Prefix - If you enter a "name root" of "Bond", and chose to use a 
prefix, all of your spies will be named "1 Bond", "2 Bond" .. "90 Bond".


Example Suffix - If you chose suffix instead of prefix, your spies will 
be named "Bond 1", "Bond 2" ...  "Bond 90".


Example None - If you chose "None" (no prefix or suffix), all of your 
spies will be named simply "Bond".  Multiple spies with the same name is legal to the 
game, but might be somewhat confusing to you, so this is not recommended.


filenamess_health_alerts_pane.htmltitleMonitor Health AlertssummaryÅ! To receive alerts for a station, simply check the box to enable alerts, and enter the minimum amount of resources per hour that the station should be receiving.contentóMonitor Health Alerts

This panel allows you to choose to be alerted when possibly negative things happen to a 
station.


To receive alerts for a station, simply check the box to enable alerts, and enter the 
minimum amount of resources per hour that the station should be receiving.


Mail
Alerts will be sent to you in game mail.  If you're in the habit of ignoring your mail or 
deleting it all by repeating Select All... Delete without looking at all of your messages, 
you must fix that habit!  You should always choose "Correspondence" from the 
dropdown box in the in-game mailbox before deleting a bunch of mail.  This will hide all 
the junk mail you've received, and only show mails from players.


Since the health alert mails are sent from your own account to yourself, they count as 
"mails sent from players".


What triggers an alert?
Several things:

    
        Any resource income on the station drops below the number you set in LacunaWaX.  
        You'll be pestered a bit if you try to set that number below 10 million, but you 
        can do so if you wish.
    
    
        Any non-alliance ships are inbound to your station.
    
    
        Any spies are found on the station who are not currently set to Counter Espionage.
            When spies are found on a station, their originating planet and even 
            empire name is not available.  However, the task to which they're currently 
            set is available.  So the closest we can come to identifying enemy 
            spies is by finding spies who aren't actively defending the station.

            If you have alliance mates who have spies on your station who aren't doing 
            anything, and you keep getting alerted that they may be enemies, tell your 
            silly alliance mates to set their spies to Counter as long as they're taking 
            advantage of your hospitality.
    
    
        If the star that your station is orbiting is unseized, the station is vulnerable, 
        and this will trigger an alert.  A station should always seize its own star.
    
    
        If the star that your station is orbiting is seized by another station, your 
        station may be more than just vulnerable; it may be under active attack.

        If your station's star has been seized by an alliance-mate's station, it's 
        certainly not under attack, but you're going to get alerted anyway.  It's a silly 
        situation; seize your own star.
    



Who should be watching a station?
You should definitely set up alerts for each station you have personally launched.  But 
some redundancy here is not a bad thing - each station should be watched by at least two 
players.  So if somebody goes on vacation or just isn't paying attention to their mail or 
whatever, your alliance will still be notified if something goes wrong.


You can choose to be alerted to problems on every station in your alliance if you wish.

filenamess_as_planet.htmltitle"Space Station thinks it's a PlanetsummaryÅx The problem with this list of known bodies is that it does not indicate whether a given body is a Planet or a Space Station. To figure that out, LacunaWaX needs to send a question to the server ("Hey, what kind of Thing is this particular body?").contentç7Space Station thinks it's a Planet

The Short Version

Double-click on the name of the station in the tree on the left, which will bring up a 
summary page about that station.  It will also refresh that tree, adding the correct 
Station-specific child leaves under your station.  You'll only need to do this one time 
(per station).


The Longer Explanation

When you log in to the game, your connection information includes a list of "bodies" that 
belong to you.  In TLE, a "body" is any thing that can orbit a star, the main ones being 
Planets, Space Stations, and Asteroids.


The problem with this list of known bodies is that it does not indicate whether a given 
body is a Planet or a Space Station.  To figure that out, LacunaWaX needs to send a 
question to the server ("Hey, what kind of Thing is this particular body?").


It's not uncommon to have 20 or more planets, and as many (or more) space stations.  It's 
not practical to check with the TLE server to determine what each one of those bodies is 
(planet or space station) each time the application runs.


So instead of asking the server about each body every time, LacunaWaX waits until you have 
checked the summary screen for that body.  Once you've done that one time, LacunaWaX will 
learn what kind of Thing that Body is (Planet or Space Station).  Once LacunaWaX has that 
information one time, it remembers it forever.


So the first time you start LacunaWaX after one of your alliance mates launches a new SS, 
LacunaWaX won't know yet that this new body is an SS, and will treat it as a planet.  
Bring up the Station's Summary page by clicking the station's name in the left tree, and 
the body will be seen as a Space Station forever.

It's most common to rename a single Smuggler Ship to "Glyph Pusher" or some such and then use that to push glyphs. However, you can use any cargo-type ship with any name you wish.contentè`Glyphs Screen

This is where you set up your preferences for the Schedule_archmin.exe 
scheduled task, and can create glyph plans, en masse if desired.


Graphical Glyphs List
This is a list of the glyphs currently on the planet.  The list doesn't do anything except 
look pretty and provide information.


Push Selected Glyphs
Many players prefer to push all the glyphs they've collected to a single planet where they 
assemble plans from recipes (mainly halls).


To push glyphs from the current planet to an assembly planet, choose that assembly 
planet's name from the drop-down, they enter the name of the ship you'd like to use to 
send the glyphs.  It's most common to rename a single Smuggler Ship to "Glyph Pusher" or 
some such and then use that to push glyphs.  However, you can use any cargo-type ship with 
any name you wish.


Since you need a few glyphs to complete some of the missions, you can choose to leave a 
few on the planet instead of pushing all of them.  You'll normally only want to do this on 
planets that have a Mission Command.  I leave 5 glyphs on my Mission planet, but you can 
choose to keep any number you wish.  Enter this number in the "Reserve glyphs for 
missions" box before setting your Glyph Push.


Requires running of Schedule_archmin.exe to actually do anything.


Arch Min Search
Along with managing Excavators, the Archaeology Ministry can be used, every six hours, to 
sift through extra ore on the planet for a glyph.  If you have enough ore, you can tell 
the Arch Min what type of ore to look for.  Generally you'll assign this to look for a 
glyph type you're low on.


Requires running of Schedule_archmin.exe to actually do anything.


Cook Glyph Recipes
Here you can create glyph plans from your existing glyphs.  Recipes for all plans are 
included, but this section is most frequently used to combine as many glyphs as possible 
into Halls of Vrbansk.  If that's all you want to do, just click the "Build as Many Halls 
as Possible" button and watch it go.
