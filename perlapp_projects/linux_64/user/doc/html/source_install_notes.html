<h1>Source Install Notes</h1>

If you're running LacunaWaX from source (meaning you're not using the Windows-only 
installer program), I'd much appreciate it if you could keep a journal of what steps you 
took to get everything working.
<p>

I've got the program running that way on both Windows and Ubuntu, but my own setup process 
has been piecemeal, and I don't have a good "how to install" document.
