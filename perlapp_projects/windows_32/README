This directory is currently just a copy of the linux_64 directory, so it needs some love.

build.sh will obviously need to become build.bat, and all the project files are referencing the linux_64 directory.

Also, once debugging is done, set all the project files to create Hide console exes (Options 2).

Fix that up, and get rid of this file.
