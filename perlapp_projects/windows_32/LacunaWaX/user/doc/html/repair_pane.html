<h1>Repair Screen</h1>

If a planet has been damaged by attack or fissure (or whatever), this pane allows you to 
repair your buildings in bulk, in the order you specify.
<p>

<h2>Using</h2>
The list on the left will show all damaged buildings on the planet.  Most of the time, 
this list will just be empty, which means that none of your buildings are damaged, and 
life is good.
<p>

When buildings are listed on the left, you'll want to select the buildings you want to 
repair, and move them to the right-hand list:
<ul>
    <li>
        You can move a single building by highlighting the building and clicking the 
        <strong>&gt;</strong> button.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can just move all of your buildings in one shot by clicking the 
        <strong>&gt;&gt;</strong> button.
    </li>
    <li>
        You can move just the glyph buildings by clicking the <strong>Glyphs</strong> 
        button.  Remember that glyph buildings repair free of charge, so you likely want 
        to repair those first.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you accidentally moved buildings that you didn't mean to move over to the 
        right-hand list, you can put them back in the same way with the 
        <strong>&lt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;&lt;</strong> buttons.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>

Buildings will be repaired in the order they appear in the list on the right side.  Each 
time you add a new building by clicking <strong>&gt;</strong>, that new building will 
appear <em>at the top of the list on the right</em>.  So, if you want your buildings 
repaired in a specific order, add the ones you want repaired last to the list first.
<p>

Once your buildings are all arranged as you want them, click the <strong>Repair</strong> 
button, and your repairs will begin.  A window will pop up giving you a running commentary 
on what's happening.  If you need to, you can cancel the repairs in progress at any time 
by simply closing that pop up window.
<p>

<h2>Resources (Important!)</h2>
Your current stored resources are shown at the bottom of the screen; those numbers will be 
updated each time you complete a round of repairs.  When you begin repairing a list of 
buildings, all of the buildings in the list will be repaired as much as possible.  If you 
were hit hard (like, by a fissure), you very probably will not have enough resources on 
your planet to be able to repair all of your buildings.
<p>

If you try to repair more buildings than you have the resources for, your stored resources 
will be taken almost down to nothing.  If running all the way out of resources is going to 
be a problem, you'll need to be careful about which buildings you add to the "to be 
repaired" list on the right.
<p>
