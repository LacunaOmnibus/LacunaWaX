<h1>Glyphs Screen</h1>

This is where you set up your preferences for the <code>Schedule_archmin.exe</code> 
scheduled task, and can create glyph plans, en masse if desired.
<p>

<h2>Graphical Glyphs List</h2>
This is a list of the glyphs currently on the planet.  The list doesn't do anything except 
look pretty and provide information.
<p>

<h2>Push Selected Glyphs</h2>
Many players prefer to push all the glyphs they've collected to a single planet where they 
assemble plans from recipes (mainly halls).
<p>

To push glyphs from the current planet to an assembly planet, choose that assembly 
planet's name from the drop-down, they enter the name of the ship you'd like to use to 
send the glyphs.  It's most common to rename a single Smuggler Ship to "Glyph Pusher" or 
some such and then use that to push glyphs.  However, you can use any cargo-type ship with 
any name you wish.
<p>

Since you need a few glyphs to complete some of the missions, you can choose to leave a 
few on the planet instead of pushing all of them.  You'll normally only want to do this on 
planets that have a Mission Command.  I leave 5 glyphs on my Mission planet, but you can 
choose to keep any number you wish.  Enter this number in the "Reserve glyphs for 
missions" box before setting your Glyph Push.

<h2>Arch Min Search</h2>
Along with managing Excavators, the Archaeology Ministry can be used, every six hours, to 
sift through extra ore on the planet for a glyph.  If you have enough ore, you can tell 
the Arch Min what type of ore to look for.  Generally you'll assign this to look for a 
glyph type you're low on.

<h2>Cook Glyph Recipes</h2>
Here you can create glyph plans from your existing glyphs.  Recipes for all plans are 
included, but this section is most frequently used to combine as many glyphs as possible 
into Halls of Vrbansk.  If that's all you want to do, just click the "Build as Many Halls 
as Possible" button and watch it go.
