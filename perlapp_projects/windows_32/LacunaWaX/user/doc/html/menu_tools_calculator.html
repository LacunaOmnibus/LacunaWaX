<h1>Tools... Calculator</h1>

<h2>Halls</h2>
Enter the current level of one of your glyph buildings, and the level you want to get it 
up to.  You'll be given the number of halls needed to make the requested upgrade.
<p>

<h2>Distance from coords</h2>
Enter the (x,y) coordinates of any two points (generally you'll use the coordinates of two 
planets, but any two points will work) to get the distance between those two points.
<p>

Often, the reason you're calculating a distance in the first place is because you want to 
know how long it will take a given ship to travel between two points.  So when you 
calculate a distance, the result will be automatically entered into the Distance input of 
the Time calculator, below.
<p>

<h2>Time</h2>
Given a distance and a rate of travel (the Speed attribute of the ship you wish to send; 
that Speed attribute can be seen in your Space Port), this gives you the time it will take 
for a ship travelling that speed to cover that distance.
<p>

<h2>Trilaterate</h2>
Occasionally you'll have the name of a planet (possibly from a mail message), but you'll 
have no idea where that planet is.  This calculator allows you to find that planet.
<p>

To do this, we need to know how much time it will take for a ship of a known speed to 
reach the target planet; we'll need this information from two of your planets.
<p>

So chose two of your planets, preferably two that are as far away from each other as 
possible.
<p>

On each of these planets:
<ol>
    <li>Record the (x,y) coordinates of the planet</li>
    <li>Open one of the Space Ports</li>
    <li>On the Send tab, enter the name of your target planet and click "Get Available 
    Ships For Target"</li>
    <li>Record the speed of your fastest ship, and the time it will take for that ship to 
    reach your target planet.  Record the speed as it's given in-game (eg h:m:s, d:h:m:s, 
    whatever.)
</ol>
<p>

Enter that information into the Trilaterate calculator.  You'll usually be given two 
candidate points; your target planet is at one of those two points.  With the information 
in hand, there's no way to mathematically determine which of those two points is the 
correct location of your target planet, so you'll need to probe both stars.
<p>

However, occasionally one of the candidate points will be outside the boundaries of the 
Expanse.  In those cases, the calculator knows for sure that that point cannot be correct.  
if the calculator only provides you with a single candidate point, that's the location of 
your target planet.
