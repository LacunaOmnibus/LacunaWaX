<h1>Monitor Health Alerts</h1>

This panel allows you to choose to be alerted when possibly negative things happen to a 
station.
<p>

To receive alerts for a station, simply check the box to enable alerts, and enter the 
minimum amount of resources per hour that the station should be receiving.
<p>

<h2>Mail</h2>
Alerts will be sent to you in game mail.  If you're in the habit of ignoring your mail or 
deleting it all by repeating Select All... Delete without looking at all of your messages, 
<em>you must fix that habit!</em>  You should always choose "Correspondence" from the 
dropdown box in the in-game mailbox before deleting a bunch of mail.  This will hide all 
the junk mail you've received, and only show mails from players.
<p>

Since the health alert mails are sent from your own account to yourself, they count as 
"mails sent from players".
<p>

<h2>What triggers an alert?</h2>
Several things:
<ul>
    <li>
        Any resource income on the station drops below the number you set in LacunaWaX.  
        You'll be pestered a bit if you try to set that number below 10 million, but you 
        can do so if you wish.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any non-alliance ships are inbound to your station.
    </li>
    <li>
        Any spies are found on the station who are not currently set to Counter Espionage.
            <dd>When spies are found on a station, their originating planet and even 
            empire name is not available.  However, the task to which they're currently 
            set <em>is</em> available.  So the closest we can come to identifying enemy 
            spies is by finding spies who aren't actively defending the station.

            <dd>If you have alliance mates who have spies on your station who aren't doing 
            anything, and you keep getting alerted that they may be enemies, tell your 
            silly alliance mates to set their spies to Counter as long as they're taking 
            advantage of your hospitality.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the star that your station is orbiting is unseized, the station is vulnerable, 
        and this will trigger an alert.  A station should always seize its own star.
    </li>
    <li>
        If the star that your station is orbiting is seized by another station, your 
        station may be more than just vulnerable; it may be under active attack.<br>

        If your station's star has been seized by an alliance-mate's station, it's 
        certainly not under attack, but you're going to get alerted anyway.  It's a silly 
        situation; seize your own star.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Who should be watching a station?</h2>
You should definitely set up alerts for each station you have personally launched.  But 
some redundancy here is not a bad thing - each station should be watched by at least two 
players.  So if somebody goes on vacation or just isn't paying attention to their mail or 
whatever, your alliance will still be notified if something goes wrong.
<p>

You can choose to be alerted to problems on every station in your alliance if you wish.
