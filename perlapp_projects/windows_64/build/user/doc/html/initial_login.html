<h1>Initial Login</h1>

The first time you run LacunaWaX, both connect buttons in the middle of the screen will be 
grayed-out.  This is because you haven't yet entered your empire name and password; you 
have to do that first.

In the top menu, choose Edit... Preferences.

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Server</strong> US1 (you can come back and fool with the PT settings later 
        if you have a PT account).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Connection Protocol</strong> 'https' is suggested.  Switch to 'http' if 
        the game is running slowly or if 'https' causes problems for you, but be aware 
        that your password will be sent in plaintext in that case, which is not secure.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Username</strong> Your TLE empire name.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Password</strong> Your TLE password.  Your sitter is sufficient for most 
        functions in LacunaWaX.  However, if you want to Fire the BFG with LacunaWaX, 
        you'll need to enter your main password, not your sitter.  This is less important 
        now, since the BFG can now be fired from the game.
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the <strong>Save</strong> button.  The preferences window will disappear, 
        and the connect button for US1 on the main screen will now be enabled.  Click it 
        to log in.
    </li>
</ul>
