<h1>Fire the BFG</h1>

Viewing this screen requires that the SS have a Parliament of at least level 25.  If it 
does not, no BFG exists, and clicking the BFG leaf in the tree will simply complain and 
then show you the Station's summary screen instead.
<p>

Firing the BFG requires that you be logged in with your full password, not your sitter.  
If you're currently logged in with your sitter, change that to your full password in 
Edit... Preferences, then <em>close and restart LacunaWaX</em>.  Simply re-connecting with 
File... Connect... will not work; you must close and restart.
<p>

Once you're logged in with your full password, enter the name of the <em>Star</em> that 
your target is orbiting, then chose the orbit number of your <em>target</em>.  The 
"reason" text is required, and will be included in the mail that gets sent out to your 
alliance members.  You can keep the default or enter anything you wish.
<p>

When you click the red "Open fire!" button, the ID of the target planet will appear in the 
Target Planet ID box.  This is for your convenience; if you plan on firing the BFG 
multiple times, you can just write that number down somewhere.  The next time you want to 
fire the BFG, you can enter that number in the box, and skip the Star Name and Orbit 
inputs.
<p>

Also, a confirmation box will pop up asking if you're sure about firing.  So if you're 
just interested in getting the target ID for later, you can click "Open fire!", then 
choose not to actually fire, and you'll still be given the target ID.
<p>

That Target Planet ID is for more than just convenience.  During an extended battle, it's 
possible one of your allies might move your target to another orbit for some reason 
(likely an attempt to reduce happiness).  If you're not paying attention, and blindly fire 
the BFG at the same star and same orbit you did yesterday, you could conceivably end up 
firing it at an ally instead of your intended target.
<p>

If you use the Target Planet ID instead, that target is what will be in the BFG's 
crosshairs, even if it had been moved.
<p>

A legend exists of a certain careless BFG gunman who did exactly what's been described 
above, and shot at one of his own alliance member's colonies.  Learn from that bonehead's 
mistakes.
