<h1>Space Station thinks it's a Planet</h1>

<h2>The Short Version</h2>

Double-click on the name of the station in the tree on the left, which will bring up a 
summary page about that station.  It will also refresh that tree, adding the correct 
Station-specific child leaves under your station.  You'll only need to do this one time 
(per station).
<p>

<h2>The Longer Explanation</h2>

When you log in to the game, your connection information includes a list of "bodies" that 
belong to you.  In TLE, a "body" is any thing that can orbit a star, the main ones being 
Planets, Space Stations, and Asteroids.
<p>

The problem with this list of known bodies is that it does not indicate whether a given 
body is a Planet or a Space Station.  To figure that out, LacunaWaX needs to send a 
question to the server ("Hey, what kind of Thing is this particular body?").
<p>

It's not uncommon to have 20 or more planets, and as many (or more) space stations.  It's 
not practical to check with the TLE server to determine what each one of those bodies is 
(planet or space station) each time the application runs.
<p>

So instead of asking the server about each body every time, LacunaWaX waits until you have 
checked the summary screen for that body.  Once you've done that one time, LacunaWaX will 
learn what kind of Thing that Body is (Planet or Space Station).  Once LacunaWaX has that 
information one time, it remembers it forever.
<p>

So the first time you start LacunaWaX after one of your alliance mates launches a new SS, 
LacunaWaX won't know yet that this new body is an SS, and will treat it as a planet.  
Bring up the Station's Summary page by clicking the station's name in the left tree, and 
the body will be seen as a Space Station forever.
