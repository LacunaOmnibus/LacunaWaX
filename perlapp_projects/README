- extra_scan.pl
    - Forcefully uses modules that aren't found by perlApp automatically.  
      There are a lot of them, and adding them into this file and then adding 
      the file as a "scanned script" in the Files tab is much easier than 
      adding them each as Implicit Modules individually.
